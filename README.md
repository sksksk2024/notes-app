## Overview

This is my first React Native app built using [Brad Traversy's](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) full tutorial ‚Äî created with **Expo** and connected to **Appwrite** as the backend.

It allowed me to explore cross-platform mobile development, and I structured the UI and logic with my existing frontend knowledge (React, Tailwind, etc.).

## My Process

### What I Learned

‚úÖ **New tools & mobile workflow:**

- Using **Expo CLI** to develop and test on mobile
- Structuring navigation with **React Navigation**
- Using **Appwrite** for auth and backend logic
- Managing mobile state and UI design

üîß **Mindset growth:**

- Learned to debug mobile app errors (Expo & Appwrite especially)
- Stayed focused despite starting with zero native experience
- Developed the discipline to finish even when momentum dropped

---

### Continued Development

üöÄ In future versions, I want to:

- Improve design using native styling or Tailwind Native
- Add features like user profile pictures and push notifications
- Connect to a proper production backend and deploy it

### My Tech Stack

üõ†Ô∏è

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Backend:** Appwrite
- **Navigation:** React Navigation
- **Styling:** StyleSheet API
- **Authentication:** Appwrite's built-in email/password auth
